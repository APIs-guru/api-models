For example, you can filter for <code>InstanceType==m4.xlarge OR InstanceType==c4.large</code>. The <code>Expression</code> for that looks like this.</p> <p> <code>{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "InstanceType", "Values": [ "m4.xlarge", “c4.large” ] } }</code> </p> <p>The list of dimension values are OR''d together to retrieve cost or usage data. You can create <code>Expression</code> and <code>DimensionValues</code> objects using either <code>with*</code> methods or <code>set*</code> methods in multiple lines. </p> </li> <li> <p>Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use multiple <code>Expression</code> types and the logical operators <code>AND/OR/NOT</code> to create a list of one or more <code>Expression</code> objects. This allows you to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on <code>((InstanceType == m4.large OR InstanceType == m3.large) OR (Tag.Type == Type1)) AND (UsageType != DataTransfer)</code>. The <code>Expression</code> for that looks like this.</p> <p> <code>{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "InstanceType", "Values": [ "m4.x.large", "c4.large" ] }}, {"Tag": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"dimensions": { "Key": "UsageType", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] } </code> </p> <note> <p>Because each <code>Expression</code> can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an Expression object that will create an error.</p> </note> <p> <code> { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "UsageType", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } } </code> </p> </li> </ul>'
