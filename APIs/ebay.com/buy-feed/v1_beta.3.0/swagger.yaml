The description of each item is excluded because these can be huge and items in an item group (an item with variations, such as size and color) can share the same description. The item descriptions are returned in a separate Descriptions gzip feed file by the getItemDescriptionFeed call.

The first line of the file is the header, which indicates the order of the values on each line. Each header is described in the Response fields section on this page. Downloading feed files Item feed files are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100 MB, the download must be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks in bytes using the Range request header. The Content-range response header indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. Important: The response is always a TSV_GZIP file. But for documentation purposes, the response is shown as JSON fields so that the value returned in each column can be explained.
